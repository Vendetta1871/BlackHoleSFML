# Black Hole SFML
***
Physics based backend wasn't written by me. It's a fork of
https://github.com/kavan010/black_hole.
***
What I've done:
* Dynamic resolution.
* Idle mod (do not re-render picture if there is no user input). \
What I plan to add:
* Anti-aliasing or better upscaling.
* Post this in AUR (arch users repository).
